        <section>
            <p>This document is modeled after the <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Creative Commons Privacy Policy</a> from <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>.</p>

<h2 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Zom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Zom’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Zom’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Zom may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy, we recommend using a browser plugin to block 3rd party tracking services, such as <a href="http://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-apps">Mobile Apps</h2>

<p>We purposefully do not include any analytics code in our mobile applications to help preserve your privacy. When using Zom to connect to 3rd party chat servers, you are relying on those service’s privacy policies as well. For example, if you use Zom with Google Talk, you should be mindful of <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>At this time, the only other data that can be submitted to a 3rd party is our opt-in, anonymized crash report data, provided by the open source crash reporting SDK from <a href="http://hockeyapp.net">HockeyApp</a>.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Zom’s websites choose to interact with Zom in ways that require Zom to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Zom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Zom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Zom. Zom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>Zom may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Zom may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Zom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Zom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Zom’s behalf or to provide services available at Zom’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Zom’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Zom will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Zom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Zom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Zom, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Zom website and have supplied your email address, Zom may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Zom and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Zom takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Zom uses cookies to help Zom identify and track visitors, their usage of Zom website, and their website access preferences. Zom visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Zom’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Zom’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2 id="analytics--social-sharing-widgets">Analytics &amp; Social Sharing Widgets</h2>

<p>Zom uses analytics on zom.im to help us monitor the number of people who visit the site. We also include social sharing widgets that are bundled with our blogging theme. We recommend using a browser plugin like <a href="http://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a> to opt-out.</p>

<h2 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If Zom, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Zom goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Zom may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Zom may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Zom’s sole discretion. Zom encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
